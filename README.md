# Landing-page
The goal of this project is to use what I have learned
so far in the Odin Project to create and style a webpage
from scratch. 

I will be building the html file from start to finish. 
Additionally, I will stylize the webpage ussing a css stylesheet.

The webpage will have a header, two sections of body content, an added 
testimonal, some images with subtext, and a footer.
